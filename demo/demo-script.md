# 200notes Claude Code Integration - Live Demo Script

## 🎬 Demo Overview
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes  
**Goal**: Show how 200notes transforms manual PROJECT.md management into intelligent, automated task tracking

---

## 🚀 Demo Script

### **Setup (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Start in demo project directory
cd demo/

# Show current state - traditional PROJECT.md
cat PROJECT.md
```

**Narration**: 
> "Here's a typical development project with a PROJECT.md file. Notice all these manual checkboxes - developers have to remember to update them manually. This is error-prone and often forgotten."

---

### **Phase 1: Install & Initialize (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Install 200notes CLI (in production this would be npm install -g)
npm link ../

# Show we're not configured yet
200notes status
# Expected: "No configuration found"

# Configure API credentials
200notes auth login
# Enter demo credentials:
# API Key: demo_key_12345
# API Secret: demo_secret_67890
# Base URL: https://demo.200notes.com

# Initialize project
200notes init "PDF Export & Stripe v0.3.0"
# Choose: "Create new project"
# Description: "Demo project showing Stripe payment integration with PDF downloads"
```

**Narration**: 
> "First, we install the 200notes CLI and connect it to our 200notes account. Then we initialize our project - this creates the connection between our local codebase and the 200notes project management system."

**Show Result**:
- `.200notes.json` file created
- `CLAUDE.md` file generated with project context
- 200notes project created in dashboard

---

### **Phase 2: Import Existing Tasks (3 minutes)**

```bash
# Create tasks from our PROJECT.md checklist
200notes task create "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations" --priority high --tags backend,stripe,webhook
200notes task create "Automatic premium content unlocking after payment" --priority high --tags backend,automation
200notes task create "PDF download rate limiting" --priority medium --tags backend,pdf,security
200notes task create "Email notifications for successful payments" --priority medium --tags backend,email
200notes task create "Loading states during payment processing" --priority medium --tags frontend,ui
200notes task create "Error handling for failed payments" --priority high --tags frontend,error-handling
200notes task create "Success animation and download link" --priority low --tags frontend,ui
200notes task create "Unit tests for payment flow" --priority high --tags testing,payment
200notes task create "Integration tests with Stripe webhooks" --priority high --tags testing,webhook
200notes task create "Performance testing for PDF generation" --priority medium --tags testing,performance

# Check our project status
200notes status
```

**Narration**: 
> "Instead of manual checkboxes, we now have proper tasks with priorities, tags, and tracking. Each task is linked to our project and can be assigned to team members."

**Show Result**:
- 10 tasks created with different priorities and tags
- Project dashboard shows task distribution
- Tasks are searchable and filterable

---

### **Phase 3: Claude Code Integration Demo (5 minutes)**

```bash
# Start Claude Code session
# (Simulate by showing what would happen)

# Show current CLAUDE.md
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Narration**: 
> "Here's the magic - CLAUDE.md is automatically generated with current project context. When I start Claude Code, it knows exactly what tasks are in progress, what's high priority, and what needs attention."

**Simulate Code Changes**:

```bash
# Simulate working on PaymentController.js
echo "// Adding webhook handling..." >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js

# Show how task mapping would work
200notes task start "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations"
```

**Narration**: 
> "When I modify PaymentController.js, the integration automatically detects this relates to our Stripe webhook task and marks it as 'in progress'. No manual updates needed!"

**Show Smart Task Detection**:

```bash
# Show how the system maps files to tasks
echo "Demonstrating keyword mapping:"
echo "- PaymentController.js → 'Stripe', 'webhook', 'payment' tasks"
echo "- PdfService.js → 'PDF', 'download', 'rate limiting' tasks"
echo "- Tests/ → all testing-related tasks"
```

---

### **Phase 4: Team Collaboration (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Show team features
200notes status --all

# Simulate task assignment
200notes task update 1 --assignee "john@team.com"
200notes task update 2 --assignee "sarah@team.com"

# Show updated CLAUDE.md
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Narration**: 
> "The system tracks who's working on what, prevents conflicts, and keeps everyone synchronized. The CLAUDE.md file is always up-to-date with current project state."

---

### **Phase 5: Progress Tracking (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Mark some tasks as completed
200notes task done "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations"
200notes task done "Automatic premium content unlocking after payment"

# Show updated status
200notes status

# Show progress tracking
echo "Project Progress:"
echo "✅ Completed: 8/10 tasks (80%)"
echo "🚧 In Progress: 1 task"
echo "⏳ Todo: 1 task"
```

**Narration**: 
> "Real-time progress tracking replaces manual PROJECT.md updates. Stakeholders can see progress instantly, and the team stays aligned on priorities."

---

### **Phase 6: Advanced Features Demo (2 minutes)**

**Show Claude Code Hooks**:
```bash
# Show hook configuration
ls -la hooks/
cat hooks/post_tool_use.sh
```

**Show Configuration**:
```bash
# Show project configuration
cat .200notes.json
```

**Show API Integration**:
```bash
# Show that this integrates with real 200notes API
200notes sync
echo "✅ Synchronized with 200notes dashboard"
```

**Narration**: 
> "Behind the scenes, intelligent hooks detect code changes and automatically update tasks. The system learns which files relate to which tasks, making tracking completely seamless."
