# 🚀 200notes Claude Code Integration - Live Demo Guide

Welcome to the complete demo guide for the 200notes Claude Code integration! This guide will walk you through a live demonstration of how manual PROJECT.md files become intelligent, automated project management.

## 🎯 Demo Overview

**Goal**: Transform a traditional PROJECT.md checklist into an intelligent, automated task management system integrated with Claude Code.

**Audience**: Developers using Claude Code for AI-assisted development  
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes  
**Key Value**: "Stop manually updating PROJECT.md - let your development workflow automatically track progress"

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have the integration built
npm run build

# Start the mock server for demo (optional - can use real 200notes)
npm run start:mock-server
```

### Demo Environment
- Clean terminal with dark theme
- Browser with 200notes dashboard open
- Demo project directory prepared
- Screen recording setup (if creating video)

---

## 📋 Demo Script

### **Step 1: The Problem (2 minutes)**

**Show**: `demo/PROJECT.md` - the "before" state

```bash
cd demo/
cat PROJECT.md
```

**Narrate**: 
> "Here's a typical developer's PROJECT.md file. Look at all these manual checkboxes - every time we complete a feature, we have to remember to manually update them. This is error-prone, often forgotten, and provides zero visibility to our team."

**Highlight Pain Points**:
- ❌ Manual checkbox updates
- ❌ Forgotten progress tracking  
- ❌ No team visibility
- ❌ No integration with actual development work

---

### **Step 2: Installation & Authentication (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Install the CLI (in real demo, this would be from npm)
npm install -g @200notes/claude-code

# Configure authentication
200notes auth login
# Enter API credentials from 200notes dashboard
```

**Demo Credentials** (for mock server):
- API Key: `demo_key_12345`
- API Secret: `demo_secret_67890`
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3001` (or https://200notes.com for real demo)

```bash
# Verify authentication
200notes auth status
```

**Narrate**: 
> "Authentication takes 30 seconds. You get your API credentials from the 200notes dashboard - it's that simple."

---

### **Step 3: Project Initialization (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Initialize our demo project
200notes init "PDF Export & Stripe v0.3.0"
# Choose: "Create new project"
# Description: "Demo project showing Stripe integration with PDF downloads"
```

**Show Results**:
```bash
# Check what was created
ls -la
cat .200notes.json
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Narrate**: 
> "Notice what happened - we now have intelligent project configuration and a CLAUDE.md file that provides context to Claude Code about our project status."

**Browser**: Show the project appearing in 200notes dashboard

---

### **Step 4: Transform Manual Checkboxes into Smart Tasks (3 minutes)**

Instead of manual checkboxes, create intelligent, trackable tasks:

```bash
# Backend tasks
200notes task create "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations" \
  --priority high --tags backend,stripe,webhook

200notes task create "Automatic premium content unlocking after payment" \
  --priority high --tags backend,automation

200notes task create "PDF download rate limiting" \
  --priority medium --tags backend,pdf,security

200notes task create "Email notifications for successful payments" \
  --priority medium --tags backend,email

# Frontend tasks  
200notes task create "Loading states during payment processing" \
  --priority medium --tags frontend,ui

200notes task create "Error handling for failed payments" \
  --priority high --tags frontend,error-handling

200notes task create "Success animation and download link" \
  --priority low --tags frontend,ui

# Testing tasks
200notes task create "Unit tests for payment flow" \
  --priority high --tags testing,payment

200notes task create "Integration tests with Stripe webhooks" \
  --priority high --tags testing,webhook

200notes task create "Performance testing for PDF generation" \
  --priority medium --tags testing,performance
```

**Show Progress**:
```bash
200notes status
```

**Browser**: Show real-time updates in dashboard

**Narrate**: 
> "Look at the difference! Instead of static checkboxes, we now have intelligent tasks with priorities, tags, assignments, and full tracking. Each task appears instantly in the team dashboard."

---

### **Step 5: The Magic - Automatic Task Tracking (4 minutes)**

**Show Claude Code Integration**:
```bash
# Show current project context
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Simulate Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Simulate working on the PaymentController
echo "// Adding Stripe webhook handling..." >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js
echo "class PaymentController {" >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js
echo "  async handleWebhook(req, res) {" >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js
echo "    // Process Stripe webhook events" >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js
echo "  }" >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js
echo "}" >> src/controllers/PaymentController.js

# Start the relevant task (in real scenario, this would be automatic via hooks)
200notes task start "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations"
```

**Show Smart Detection**:
```bash
# Demonstrate keyword mapping
echo "File-to-task mapping in action:"
echo "PaymentController.js → 'Stripe', 'webhook', 'payment' tasks"
echo "PdfService.js → 'PDF', 'download', 'rate limiting' tasks"
echo "Tests/ → all testing-related tasks"
```

**Browser**: Show task status updated to "in progress"

**Narrate**: 
> "This is the magic - the system automatically detected that I'm working on PaymentController.js and connected it to our Stripe webhook task. No manual updates needed!"

---

### **Step 6: Team Collaboration (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Show team features
200notes status --all

# Assign tasks to team members (simulate team environment)
200notes task update 1 --assignee "sarah@team.com"
200notes task update 2 --assignee "john@team.com"
200notes task update 8 --assignee "mike@team.com"

# Show updated project status
200notes status
```

**Show Updated CLAUDE.md**:
```bash
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Browser**: Show team assignments in dashboard

**Narrate**: 
> "This isn't just for solo developers. The system provides real-time team collaboration - everyone can see who's working on what, preventing conflicts and keeping the team synchronized."

---

### **Step 7: Progress Tracking & Completion (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Complete some tasks (simulate work completion)
200notes task done "Stripe webhook for payment confirmations"
200notes task done "Automatic premium content unlocking after payment"

# Start work on other tasks
200notes task start "PDF download rate limiting"
200notes task start "Unit tests for payment flow"

# Show updated project status
200notes status

# Show updated CLAUDE.md with progress
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Browser**: Show updated progress in dashboard

**Narrate**: 
> "Real-time progress tracking replaces manual PROJECT.md updates. Stakeholders can see progress instantly - 20% complete, 2 tasks in progress, clear priorities for what's next."

---

### **Step 8: Before & After Comparison (1 minute)**

**Split Screen Comparison**:

**Before** (show original PROJECT.md):
- ❌ Manual checkboxes
- ❌ No team visibility  
- ❌ Forgotten updates
- ❌ No development integration

**After** (show current state):
- ✅ Intelligent task tracking
- ✅ Real-time team collaboration
- ✅ Automatic progress updates
- ✅ Claude Code integration
- ✅ Smart file-to-task mapping

---

### **Step 9: Advanced Features Preview (1 minute)**

```bash
# Show configuration
cat .200notes.json

# Show hooks setup
ls -la hooks/

# Show API integration
200notes sync
```

**Narrate**: 
> "Behind the scenes: intelligent hooks detect code changes, smart algorithms map files to tasks, and everything syncs in real-time with your team dashboard."
